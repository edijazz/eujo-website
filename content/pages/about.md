We are a 17-piece big band consisting of some of the finest jazz musicians studying at the University of Edinburgh. We perform throughout the academic year, at venues such as The Jazz Bar on Chambers Street, The Balmoral, The Pleasance Cabaret Bar. and Potterrow. Each year we have our sell-out flagship event: Jazz Club Time Machine! We take bookings for society, charity and private events - our gigs are always packed full of people, energy, and of course great music!

# Rehearsals

We rehearse every Wednesday during term time, in the Jazz Bar from 3.30-6.30pm. The bar located in the Old Town of Edinburgh and is open for anyone to pop in and listen in to our rehearsals in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere.

# Auditions

Auditions take place early in Semester one. All band members re-audition to make the process as fair as possible and to ensure we are the highest quality band we can be. There is no prerequisite standard, though some jazz experience helps. A willingness to give an audition a go is essential!

The next auditions for EUJO will be held in September 2020. Check our Facebook page for more information about audition packs, which will be released during Welcome Week 2020.
