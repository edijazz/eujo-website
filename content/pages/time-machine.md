# Jazz Club Time Machine

The wait is over. Jazz Club Time Machine is here. Following a sell-out performance in January, we invite you on a journey with the Edinburgh University Jazz Orchestra as we travel through the decades, performing an eclectic array of the most timeless big band pieces, jazz standards and sing-along bangers! Swing from the 1920s, through the golden years of jazz and into 1950s classics. Get some Saturday night fever as we groove in the 1970s and boogie in the 1980s. As we step into the new millennium, finish the night off with contemporary jazz and popular tunes with a twist.
  
  
So we invite all students, staff, and friends of the University to join us for one last time this semester for a great night of dancing, singing, and most of all, some incredible jazz!
